<h1>RU58841 vs YK11 – Muscle Gains or Hair Loss Protection?</h1>

<p>If you’ve ever looked into SARMs, you’ve probably seen <strong>YK11</strong> pop up as one of the strongest muscle builders. But then there’s <strong>RU58841</strong>, which is basically its opposite—it’s used to <strong>stop hair loss</strong>, not build muscle. I’ve used both, and this article will compare them from first-hand experience.</p>

<p>This isn’t your typical apples-to-apples SARM comparison. Instead, this article is for guys who are trying to get <strong>big without going bald</strong>. I’ll break down how each works, how I used them, what side effects I noticed, and whether they’re worth using solo or together.</p>

<h2>What is RU58841?</h2>

<p><strong>RU58841</strong> is a topical anti-androgen. That means it <strong>blocks DHT at the scalp</strong>, helping prevent hair loss—especially if you’re genetically prone to male pattern baldness.</p>

<p>I started using RU58841 when I was 28 after noticing a receding hairline. I applied it <strong>once daily at 50mg</strong> to my temples and crown using a dropper bottle. It dries fast and doesn’t leave residue if you use the ethanol-based version.</p>

<h3>My Results Using RU58841:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stopped shedding within 3 weeks</li>
  <li>Small regrowth on the hairline after 2 months</li>
  <li>No systemic side effects (no changes in libido or hormones)</li>
  <li>Super easy to apply post-shower</li>
</ul>

<p>I kept my hairline stable the whole time I was on cycle with other SARMs. RU58841 is not a cure, but it’s easily the best thing I’ve used to <strong>prevent hair loss while on SARMs or testosterone</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Blocks DHT locally, not systemically</li>
  <li>Prevents hair loss during SARMs/steroid cycles</li>
  <li>No liver toxicity or hormonal suppression</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Needs daily use</li>
  <li>Doesn’t regrow thick hair</li>
  <li>Needs good application technique</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Hair Loss Prevention During Cycles, DHT-Sensitive Users</p>

<h2>What is YK11?</h2>

<p><strong>YK11</strong> is a powerhouse when it comes to muscle gains. It works by <strong>blocking myostatin</strong>, which lets your body build muscle beyond its normal limit. I ran it at <strong>10mg/day for 6 weeks</strong> during a lean bulk cycle.</p>

<h3>My Results Using YK11:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Insane pumps by Week 2</li>
  <li>Hard, dry muscle gains (not bloated)</li>
  <li>Strength increase in bench and overhead press</li>
  <li>Mild suppression starting Week 5</li>
  <li>Hair started shedding slightly—hence RU58841</li>
</ul>

<p>YK11 hits fast and hard. The muscle quality is way better than anything I got with Ostarine or LGD. But the trade-off is it comes with <strong>some androgenic effects</strong>, which is why I combined it with RU58841 the second time I ran it.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Massive strength and size gains</li>
  <li>Dry, dense muscle</li>
  <li>Perfect for bulking or power cycles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Suppression around Week 4–5</li>
  <li>Possible hair shedding (DHT-related)</li>
  <li>Needs PCT</li>
</ul>

<h2>RU58841 vs YK11 – Should You Use Them Together?</h2>

<p>This is the part I really want to share from my experience. The first time I used YK11, I got great gains—but <strong>noticed more hair shedding than usual</strong>. The second time, I combined it with RU58841. I had the same muscle gains, <strong>but almost no hair loss</strong>.</p>

<p>So, while they serve different purposes, they actually work well <strong>together</strong>:</p>
